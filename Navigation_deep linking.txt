Deep linking is a method that allows your app to be opened to a specific screen or route when a user clicks on a URL or an intent from another app. Instead of just launching the appâ€™s home screen, deep links navigate the user directly to a targeted location inside your app.

============= Types of Deep Linking =============

-------- 1. Traditional Deep Linking: --------  

Requires the app to be installed.
Clicking the link only works if the app is already installed.
Example: myapp://verify_user?userId=123&userEmail=user@example.com


-------- 2. Universal Linking (iOS) & App Links (Android): ---------

Works even if the app is not installed.
If the app is installed, the link opens the app.
If not installed, it opens the web version (if configured).
Example: https://mywebsite.com/verify_user?userId=123&userEmail=user@example.com


-------- 3. Deferred Deep Linking: -------- 

The link works even before the app is installed.
After installation, the app opens to the correct screen with the passed data.
