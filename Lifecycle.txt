8 stages of Lifecycle in flutter

- createState()
- initState()
- didChangeDependencies()
- build()
- didUpdateWidget()
- setState()
- deactivate()
- dispose()

1. createState(): This method is called only for creation of Stateful Widget
2. initState(): Method is called once, and executes before widget tree is built.
5. didUpdateWidget: is called anytime the app hot reloads
