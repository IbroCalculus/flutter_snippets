  firebase_core: ^2.24.0

https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#sign-in-test-cli


CREATE BOTH APP PROJECT (ie flutter_firebase2) AND FIREBASE PROJECT (ie flutter-project2)

--- In firebase console ---
 - Select flutter (alternative to android, ios, web, Unity)
 

======= ONE TIME SETUP ON COMPUTER (You don't have to do this again if already done on you computer, except perhaps; firebase login and firebase logout) ========

	---- Within the website ---
	- Windows - npm:
		1. Install Node.js			(If you don't already have npm installed on your windows
		2. Install the firebase CLI:
			IN CMD, no specific directory, run the command: npm install -g firebase-tools.		
			( cmd >firebase --version TO CHECK IF FIREBASE INSTALLED)

- Back to firebase Step 1:
	- In windows CMD, run command: firebase login (You can logout using 'firebase logout')
	- Allow firebase to collect CLI and Emulator ... (Just type n). email selection app will pop up. Choose your firebae email and login.

- IN CMD, anywhere: dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
	NB: Warning may show up to set path, if not already set. The path is thus: C:\Users\isuleiman\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin. ( I did in both Environment and System variables)

- IN PROJECT'S FIREBASE, ADD SHA1 AND SHA256 within Project Setting (CHECK: SHA Keys.txt)
  NB: IF perhaps forgot to add SHA, and later do it, you can always rerun the flutterfire configure to reconfigure/update.


- IN Project directory CMD > flutterfire configure --project=<Project-name>			# <- You will find this in the firebase step-by-step instruction, just copy and paste 

NB: Some cmds:
firebase:projects list		- list all projects on firebase

===================== FOR EVERY PROJECT (NOT one time) ============================
- IN PARTICULAR PROJECT'S CMD: flutterfire configure. 	(If this does not work in android studio, open the project's root directory and run in CMD shell) 
- Select the project from the list of firebase projects + Enter, then select the apps using Ctrl for check and uncheck + Enter. 


==== In main.dart =====
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart';

void main() async {

  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );

  runApp(MyApp());
}
